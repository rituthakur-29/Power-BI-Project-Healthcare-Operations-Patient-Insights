### 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of hospital operations, patient demographics, doctor efficiency, and financial metrics. Built using a mock healthcare dataset, it provides actionable insights into resource utilization, patient behavior, and revenue trends for better healthcare management.

### 🎯 Objectives
Track total patients, revenue per patient, and length of stay.

Analyze no-show appointments, doctor workload, and departmental efficiency.

Segment patients by age, gender, and location.

Visualize admission trends and revenue distribution by city.

Compare insurance vs out-of-pocket payments to highlight cost coverage differences.

### ✅ Key KPIs
KPI	Description
- Total Patients Treated	Unique count of patients admitted
- Revenue per Patient	Avg. billing per patient from the Billing table
- Avg. Length of Stay	Average number of inpatient days per admission
- Readmission Rate (%)	% of patients admitted more than once
- Doctor Utilization Rate	% of completed appointments per doctor
